Data are from the balloon dataset. 
For the unit tests, we only consider the validation subset (which is smaller).

We included a new category with label 1 to detect images with a single balloon inside.
We removed annotations from two samples (sample with image id: 4 and 8).
We included a new image: "fixture_1024x1300.jpg" for our unit tests
