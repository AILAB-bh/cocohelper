# Mission 
Microsoft COCO is both a large-scale dataset and a data annotation format.
Since its first release, COCO has emerged as a widely adopted annotation 
standard for object detection, segmentation, and captioning.
Despite Microsoft providing a simple API to interact with the COCO format, 
performing complex analysis and operations within and across COCO datasets 
requires ad-hoc implementations by the users.

Our library, COCO Helper, makes working with the COCO format considerably 
easier.
COCO Helper allows to efficiently run complex operations such as statistical 
analysis and dataset arithmetic using just a few lines of code.

 - [Roadmap](doc/src-man/roadmap.md)

 

## Installation
To install the library you can download the latest wheel package from this repo
and install through **pip**, **poetry**, or other python package managers.

> NB: We are still working to publish the library to public PyPi.



## Usage
Examples of usage can be found in [usage.md](doc/src-man/usage.md) and in 
the [notebooks](notebooks/) folder.
