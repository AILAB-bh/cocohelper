# Mission 
#### An Open-Source Library to Make COCO Simpler
Microsoft COCO is a large-scale dataset and data annotation format.
Today, COCO is a widely adopted standard for object detection, segmentation, and captioning.

COCOHelper makes working with the COCO format super-easy! 
You can use it to efficiently run complex operations such as statistical 
analysis and dataset arithmetic with just a few lines of code. 
Check our documentation and tutorials to learn how!
